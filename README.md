# GOAT Of Tennis Prediction Model

Dataset: [JeffSackmann Dataset](https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp)

Objective: Find the Greatest Tennis Player of All Time using Machine Learning Algorithms, considering their entire career statistics.
Steps:
1) Filtering Players based on Grandslams won
2) Preparing our dataset - Data Cleaning and Feature Extraction
3) Model Training - Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression
4) Calculating Composite Score for Each Player
5) Sorting the Composite Score and Declaring the G.O.A.T of Tennis

We brainstormed several ideas, outlining the respective pros and cons, and finally settled on this solution. Since not a lot of research has been done on Tennis Dataset, preparing the data and finding the best solution was a challenging task.
